Introduction:
Predicting insurance premiums accurately is crucial for insurance companies to assess risk and set appropriate pricing for policies. This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict insurance premiums based on various factors such as age, gender, medical history(bmi), expenses and more.

Algorithms Used:
The following machine learning algorithms are utilized in this project:

Ridge Regression: Ridge regression is employed to mitigate multicollinearity and overfitting, providing a stable solution for predicting premiums.
Linear Regression: Simple linear regression is used as a baseline model for comparison with other algorithms.
XGBoost: XGBoost, an efficient implementation of gradient boosting, is utilized to model complex relationships and capture nonlinearities in the data.
Neural Network Regression: Neural networks are employed to uncover intricate patterns and nonlinear relationships, enhancing the predictive accuracy of the model.
